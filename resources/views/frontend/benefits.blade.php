                  Something Wonderful Happens!
               </h2>
               <p>
                  Music has an amazing ability to cause us to think, or feel, in different ways than we would have otherwise. Bible Music sets a mood in which the mind is able to see Bible passages from a different perspective. You will encounter new insights from powerful Bible passages. It's almost like being in a spiritual oasis. Simply wonderful.

                  It’s The Easiest Way to Memorize God’s Word.<br>
               </h2>
               <p>
                  You don’t even have to try to memorize the passages. All you do is press play and let the music do the work. When a melody comes to mind so do the passages.

               </h2>
               <p>
                  We really like this one. Many people tell us how their smallest children are able to recite powerful Bible promises in song. It is believed that a child’s general personality is developed at a young age. What better time to draw their minds to God in song. This is simply the best for Home Schooling.

                  The soothing music brings a calming effect upon the whole family. Such a blessing for the home.

                  God’s promises in song are among the most powerful tools you can have to fight the fight of faith.
               </p>
               <p>
                  When Jehoshaphat faced utter destruction from his enemies, he turned to God in a marked way. In going out to battle he “appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.” II Chronicles 20: 21.
               </p>
               <p>
                  These brave singers went out Before the army.  Echoing in the minds of the people was the thought: “Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you,… for the LORD will be with you.”…”for the battle is not yours, but God’s.” II Chronicles 20: 17,15. This song is on SS III.

                  If you want to be equipped for success in your walk to eternal life, then God’s Word in Song may prove to be one of the greatest blessings of your experience.

                  God’s Word in Song is Powerful Evangelism.<br>
               </h2>
               <p>
                  Music is a universal language. You will find that some people will listen to a Bible Music CD long before they will want to have a Bible study. Yet, while they are listening to the soothing peaceful music, God’s Word is speaking to the mind. This brings them face to face with the wonderful plan of salvation.
               </p>
               <p>
                  We have witnessed this powerful form of evangelism first hand. Patti Vaillant the singer, songwriter, of the Bible Music series, gave a friend a “Scripture Songs III” to play. While listening to it in the evening, one song really grabbed her. She played it over and over. God’s spirit was speaking as she listened to the music. It was at this time that she broke down and surrendered her life to God.

               <p>
                  Give the gift of life, give someone you love Bible Music.

               <p>
                  When you add up all the blessings of Bible Musics, you will wonder how you ever got along without them. Can you tell we love Bible Music? We believe you will too.
